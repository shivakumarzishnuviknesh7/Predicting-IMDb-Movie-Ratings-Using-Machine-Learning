The entertainment industry relies heavily on data to gauge the success of movies and understand audience preferences. This project leverages machine learning techniques to predict IMDb ratings of movies based on various features such as duration, number of votes, and metascore. By utilizing a comprehensive dataset of movies, we aim to uncover patterns and insights that can help in understanding what factors contribute to higher movie ratings.
